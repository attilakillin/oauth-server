                        <p>
                            This usually means that there's a programming error on the resource server side,
                            or that someone is trying to get an access token in your name.

                        <p>This might mean that a third party tried to request an authorization in your name.</p>

                        <p>
                            The request contained a valid client ID, but the redirect URI was either missing,
                            or it was not registered as one of the client's redirect URIs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This might mean that a third party is trying to bypass user authorization
                            and gain access to their resources without their approval.
                        </p>
